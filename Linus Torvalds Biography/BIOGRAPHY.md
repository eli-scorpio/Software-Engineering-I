# Biography of Linus Torvalds

## Intro
I have chosen to write a biography on Linus Torvalds as he inspired me due to his firm  
stance on open source development and his work on free software such as Linux and Git.  
Torvalds decision to make Linux open source stimulated the free software movement and      
aided many tech companies from small to large with open source. "for complex technical  
issues you really need open source simply because the problem space ends up being too  
complex to manage inside one single company. Even a big and competent tech company.”   

## Origins
Creator of Linux and Git, Linus Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on the 28th of  
December, 1969. He attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996, where he earned  
his master's in computer science. During his MSc, he wrote a thesis called Linux: A Portable  
Operating System. When Torvalds was 11 years old, he began programming in BASIC on a  
Commodore VIC-20. Later on, he bought a Sinclair QL, which he highly modified, in particular  
its operating system since there was a lack of software for the Sinclair QL in Finland, and  
consequently he wrote his own assembler and editor for it (He also wrote Pac-Man graphics  
libraries). Eventually Torvalds bought an Intel 80386-based clone of an IBM PC before he  
received a MINIX copy, which then allowed him to begin his work on Linux.   

## Torvalds' Work

### Linux
Shortly after Torvalds obtained a MINIX copy of the IBM PC, the first prototypes of Linux  
were publicly released. The first version, Version 1.0 was released on the 14th of March 1994.  
From 1997 to 1999, Torvalds helped 86open to choose the standard binary format (format in which   
file information is stored in binary) for Linux and Unix. Torvalds used Bitkeeper, a proprietary  
version control system for the development of the Linux Kernel for which he was criticized  
consequently it inspired him to create Git a free software alternative to BitKeeper. Currently,  
Torvalds is sponsored by the Linux Foundation so he can work full-time on improving Linux. Almost  
all of the work on Linux is now performed by the open source community where programmers from all  
around the world send their ideas for improvements to the maintainers of Linux. Different companies  
have also helped with the development and improvement of the Linux kernels. In an interview with  
Jeremy Andrews, Torvalds credited the success of Linux 100% to  the Licensing "I think everybody  
involved ends up being much happier when they know that everybody has equal rights, and nobody is  
special with regards to licensing".  

The mascot for the Linux kernel is a penguin called Tux.   

### Git
Linus Torvalds design for Git was inspired by BitKeeper. Initially Git was a low level version  
control system engine but later became a complete version control system that was available to  
use at a high level. Git is very efficient at handling large projects, Torvalds stated that Git  
is very fast and scalable (fetching version history from a local repository can be x100 times  
faster than fetching from a remote server). Git also provides branching and merging supporting  
non-linear development. Git is mainly devloped on the Linux however it is also supports many of  
todays Operating Systems such as macOS and Windows. In an interview with The Linux Foundation,  
Torvalds said that Git was also "designed to do things that people considered “hard” before git".  
Things you do very often on a version control system eg. merging went from being a difficult task  
to a very simple and straightforward task with Torvalds unique design of Git. In an interview with  
the Linux Foundation Torvalds was asked why has Git been so widely adopted and his response was  
that once people figured out it enabled easy, reliable backups and private test repositories   
they could never go back to other version control systems.   

## Open Source 
“money really isn’t that great of a motivator. It doesn’t pull people together. Having a common project,  
and really feeling that you really can be a full partner in that project, that motivates people, I think.”   
 
Linus Torvalds is firm believer in open source development and even says that "open source is the  
only right way to do software". In a TED interview Linus talks about how the decision to use open  
source licensing sparked the helpful feedback he got back from the community. He talks about how it was   
a revelation when people started commenting giving him ideas for the Linux Kernel and how it led to the  
current state of Linux. It is evident that Linus Torvelds decision to make Linux open source has made a  
huge impact on the programming community and helped numerous people and companies for free. This is  
truly inspirational as money was not the motive. It was the passion of multiple programmers who invested  
their time into researching the source code of the Linux kernel and suggested ideas to the maintainers,  
resulting in the effective, efficient and extensive development and improvement of the Linux kernel.
