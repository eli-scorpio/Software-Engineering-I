Using Github API to measure engineering

## Idea
For this project I my current plan is to gather data about an individual and all their repositories. This information will contain data on the commits of a repository and the committers. I will use this data to make a bar chart of contributors vs no. of commits. This visualisation of data could be helpful for a recruiter to see how much the individual contributes to team projects in relation to their team.

## Installation
### To install dependencies run the command:
bash install.sh

## Run
### To run the program run the command:
bash runscript.sh
